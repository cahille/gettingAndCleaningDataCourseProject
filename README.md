# gettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
a nice little repo for the course project from Getting and Cleaning Data, the third course in the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course

To run the script, simply open up R and run

source("run_analysis.R")

run_analysis.R will read in some few files, combine as per the instructions and compute means across selected data columns for the 30 included subjects.

Upon completion, a file named tidyData.txt will be completed, which contains the tidy data set requested by the project.
